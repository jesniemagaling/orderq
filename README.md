OrderQ is a **QR-based food ordering system** built with **Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**.  
It gives restaurants a simple way to offer a digital menu and ordering experience without requiring customers to download an app.

## Overview

OrderQ is designed for small and mid-sized restaurants that want a **faster, more convenient dining experience** for their customers.

Instead of waiting for a server to take their order, guests can:

1. Scan a QR code at their table
2. Browse the restaurant’s menu online
3. Add items to their cart and place an order
4. Track their order status in real time
5. View a digital receipt before heading to the cashier

This makes the dining process smoother for both staff and customers.
